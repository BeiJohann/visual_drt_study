# Visual DRT Study Web App

This web application is part of a research project investigating how users interact with and interpret dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques. The study presents participants with visualisations generated by techniques like t-SNE, UMAP, MDS, and Isomap, and asks them to complete perception-based analytic tasks.

The platform was built using **Flask (Python)** for the backend and **D3.js** for the interactive frontend.

## Features

- 320 interactive trials grouped into 5 experiments (E1â€“E5)
- Dynamic scatterplot visualisation with task-specific rendering
- Custom lasso selection tool (multi-cluster for E1, single selection for others)
- Participant questionnaire (age, gender, background)
- Real-time trial progression with experiment/task context
- Automatic and manual result saving to `.json` for post-analysis

## Experiments

1. **E1 â€“ Cluster Identification**  
   Select visually separable clusters from scatterplots.  
   â†’ Multi-cluster lasso with different colours.

2. **E2 â€“ Membership Assignment**  
   Select the cluster containing a red-highlighted point.

3. **E3 â€“ Distance Comparison**  
   Select the cluster closest to a highlighted cluster.

4. **E4 â€“ Density Comparison**  
   Select the most densely packed cluster.

5. **E5 â€“ Preference Ranking**  
   Rank 10 visualisations by subjective preference (done per dataset).
