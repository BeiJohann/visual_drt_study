  <h2>Welcome to the Visual Analytics Study</h2>

  <p>
    This study investigates how humans perceive and interpret 2D scatter plots derived from high-dimensional data using various dimensionality reduction methods.
    Your participation will help researchers understand which visual representations are most effective for identifying patterns and structures in complex data.
  </p>

  <h3>Study Procedure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The study will take approximately <b>30–40 minutes</b> in a single session.</li>
    <li><b>Accuracy is more important than speed</b> — take your time to answer carefully.</li>
    <li>The study must be completed in one sitting, but short breaks are allowed (e.g., for restroom use).</li>
    <li>You can click the <b>Pause</b> button during the study to temporarily hide the screen and resume later.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is a Scatter Plot?</h3>
  <p>
    A scatter plot is a two-dimensional visualization where each point represents one data item. The distance between points reflects their similarity in the original high-dimensional space:
    similar items appear close together, while dissimilar items appear farther apart. We use the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/690/palmer+penguins-3"> Palmer penguin dataset</a> for all scatterplot in this introduction.

      The Penguins dataset, which contains measurements for three penguin species from the Antarctic.  
      Features like body mass and flipper length can overlap between species.

  <h3>What are Clusters?</h3>
  <p>
    Clusters are groups of points that form visually coherent regions in the scatter plot. These clusters often represent similar items in the underlying data.
    You can recognize them by looking for <b>dense regions</b> that are spatially separated from others. 
    Clusters can vary in:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Size</b>: the number of points in the cluster</li>
      <li><b>Density</b>: how closely packed the points are within a given area</li>
      <li><b>Shape</b>: clusters can be round, elongated, or irregular</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

      <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; margin-top: 5px;">
        Measurements like flipper length and bill length separate penguin species clearly.

        Well-separated clusters are easy to identify. This could be a possible selection for the first task in the study.

  <h3>Ground Truth vs. Visual Clusters</h3>
  <p>
    In many datasets, each data point belongs to a known category — for example, in the Penguin dataset, each penguin is identified as a specific species.
    These known categories are called the <b>ground truth</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, when looking at a scatter plot, we can only see how points are arranged in two dimensions. 
    <b>Visual clusters</b> are the groups that can be recognized directly from the plot, based solely on the spatial arrangement of points — regardless of their true category.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this study, all points will be shown in <b>gray</b> without category labels. 
    This means you will need to identify clusters based off their visible structure, without any hints from the original data classes. The examples shown are possible clusters selected from a human perception.

  <h3>Using the Lasso Tool</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Click and hold the left mouse button to start drawing a selection shape.</li>
    <li>Draw around the points you wish to select, then release the mouse button to complete the selection.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Reset</b> button to clear your current selection.</li>
    <li>A point can belong to only one cluster. If you lasso a point again, it will be removed from its previous cluster and assigned to the new one.</li>
    <li><b>Not all points have to be in a cluster</b> — leave unclustered points as they are if they don't clearly belong to a group.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What Will You Be Doing?</h3>
  <p>
    You will be shown several scatter plots and asked to perform different tasks:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Select clearly visible clusters using the lasso tool</li>
    <li>Identify the cluster containing a highlighted (red) point</li>
    <li>Select the cluster closest to a reference cluster</li>
    <li>Choose the most densely packed cluster</li>
    <li>Rank all projections based on clarity and visual structure</li>
  </ul>


  <p>
    Each task block starts with an example to help you understand the task. The full study takes approximately <b>30–40 minutes</b>.
    Your responses will be recorded anonymously.
